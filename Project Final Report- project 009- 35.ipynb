    "### Introduction \n",
    "It is important to understand how different players engage with a video game research server to manage resources and plan effective recruitment strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, gathers detailed gameplay information from a custom Minecraft server. Because maintaining this project demands substantial resources, the team must identify which players are most likely to produce large amounts of data. Doing so helps them focus their recruitment efforts on players who will provide the most useful and impactful contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on determining which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that recruitment efforts can be better targeted. Specifically, we explore **whether a player’s experience level in Minecraft can be predicted using their age and total played hours**. We selected this focus because recruiters who aim to maximize gameplay data, such as total hours played, may benefit from understanding how these characteristics relate to experience. Our findings can help identify which types of players should be prioritized if the goal is to target particular age groups or players with the potential to generate more extensive gameplay data. Overall, we aim to determine whether measurable player characteristics are associated with being more experienced, which may indicate a higher likelihood of contributing large data.\n",
